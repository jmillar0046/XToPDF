✅ Document structure (text, paragraphs, tables)
✅ Image embedding (JPEG, PNG, TIFF)
✅ Low-level graphics (lines, shapes, paths)
✅ Text rendering with fonts
✅ PDF manipulation (merge, split)
✅ PDF reading and modification
✅ Form filling (AcroForms)
✅ Digital signatures
❌ HTML conversion (no built-in support)
❌ SVG conversion (no built-in support)

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Apache 2.0 license** - no source disclosure required
- ✅ **Already in dependencies** (used for PDF merging)
- ✅ Mature and stable (20+ years)
- ✅ Active development and community
- ✅ Comprehensive API for PDF creation and manipulation
- ✅ Good documentation
- ✅ Lower memory footprint than iText

**Cons:**
- ❌ No HTML-to-PDF converter (need alternative for HtmlToPdfService)
- ❌ No SVG-to-PDF converter (need alternative for SvgToPdfService)
- ❌ API less intuitive than iText for document layout
- ❌ Font embedding more manual

**Migration Effort:** Simple services (text, images, tables): 2-3 days; Canvas-based services (CAD, 3D): 3-5 days; HTML/SVG services: 5-7 days (need additional libraries)

**Verdict:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Recommended - Best balance of licensing, capability, and effort

**Conclusion:**

XToPDF is a well-engineered, comprehensive document conversion platform with excellent architecture and test coverage. It fills a significant gap in the open-source ecosystem by providing CAD/3D conversion capabilities not available elsewhere.

**The single critical issue is the iText AGPL dependency**, which must be resolved for the project to reach its full potential. After migrating to Apache PDFBox:

- ✅ Legally compliant for all use cases
- ✅ Commercially friendly  
- ✅ Competitive with paid solutions
- ✅ Positioned as the industry-leading open-source PDF converter

**Recommendation:** Invest 6-8 weeks to replace iText with PDFBox, then position XToPDF as the premier open-source alternative to expensive commercial solutions like Aspose and PDFTron.

**Project Viability:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - Excellent project with clear path to success
